#Github Workshop


### Download and Setup Github Client
We will use SourceTree from Atlassian for this Demo but there are many other GUI clients out there. You can also do all of this from the git CLI.

- Go to [https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/download/](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/download/) and download the app.
- Follow installation requirements and enter your github login information.
- If you have a directory with git projects now would be the time to link it.


### Getting started
- Create a remote repository for your "Project"
- Give it a name that explains a little about what you will do.
- Don't forget to add a description.
- Clone the project to your project directory *I reccomend not calling it git*
- Cread a file called README.md
	- This is a markdown file
- Write some notes about the project.
	- [Daring Fireball - Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (How to use markdown)
- Commit your changes using SourceTree and push it to your remote repository.

### Switch to Functions


### Forking and Pull Requests
- Fork a classmates project to your repository
- Clone it using SourceTree to a **NEW** project directory
